## Installation

To start using scrolley, add it to your project using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) by running:

```
// npm
npm install --save scrolley

// yarn
yarn add scrolley
```

## Setup

To start listening to [Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) scroll events, simply import **Scrolley** somewhere in your project, like so:

```js
import 'scrolley'
```

And that's it! 🙌

## Usage

**Scrolley**'s events can be added/removed on a DOM element, just like any other native event, like `click`, `mouseenter`, or `mousemove`.

```js
...
// Get your Element
const element = document.querySelector('.el')
// Define a callback when the element scrolls
const callbackFn = event => console.log(event)

// Subscribe
element.addEventListener('scrollDown', callbackFn)

// Unsubscribe
element.removeEventListener('scrollDown', callbackFn)
```

This library also supports a handful of other scroll events!

## Events

Below are the events that this module provides:

| Event name         | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scrollUp`         | Fires immediately after the `Element` scrolls upward.                        |
| `scrollDown`       | Fires immediately after the `Element` scrolls downward.                      |
| `scrollToTop`      | Fires immediately (once) after the `Element` scrolls to the very top.        |
| `scrollToBottom`   | Fires immediately (once) after the `Element` scrolls to the very bottom.     |
| `scrollFromTop`    | Fires immediately (once) after the `Element` scrolls from the very top.      |
| `scrollFromBottom` | Fires immediately (once) after the `Element` scrolls bottom the very bottom. |

## Examples

Check out this simply [Storybook demo](https://scrolley.netlify.com/). It was built with React. However, **Scrolley** is plain ol' vanilla JavaScript. It can work with anything JavaScript supported app, plugin, library, or framework.
